# Thermo Craft tutorial

Evaluate bounded IF97 water properties and optimize two extraction pressures in a fixed Rankine cycle. This guide uses the examples shipped with version 0.2.0.

## 1. Install and run the example

Open the package root after extracting the ZIP. The bundled wheel was
built for Linux x86-64 with a CPython 3.10+ stable ABI and tested with
CPython 3.12. Create a virtual environment with a compatible Python.

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --no-deps packages/*.whl
```

If the wheel tag is incompatible, build the supplied Rust/Python source
on the target system with Rust 1.88+ and Maturin 1.9.6. Cargo needs the
locked dependencies available from its registry or cache.

```sh
python -m pip install 'maturin==1.9.6'
maturin build --release --locked --out dist
python -m pip install --no-deps dist/*.whl
```

```python
from thermo_craft import Prepared, load_example

case = load_example()
prepared = Prepared(case["model"])
row = prepared.evaluate(case["parameters"], trace=True)
assert row["status"] == "complete", row
print(row["id"], row["steps"], row["score"])
print(list(row["metrics"]))
```

The model is validated when you create `Prepared`. A malformed model
raises `ValueError`. A well-formed batch can still contain an invalid,
infeasible, or interrupted candidate. Its row carries a status and
detail. The optimizer convention is to minimize `score`.

## 2. Run the domain workflow

The following examples continue in the same Python session.

### Search extraction pressures

The Rankine example uses pascals and kelvin. Candidate order is
`[low_extraction_pa, high_extraction_pa]`. Feasibility requires
condenser < low < high < boiler and a valid cycle balance and exhaust
quality. Score is negative net efficiency. Full metrics include
specific work and heat in J/kg.

```python
for pressures in [[200000.0, 1200000.0], case["parameters"]]:
    row = prepared.evaluate(pressures)
    if row["status"] == "complete":
        m = row["metrics"]
        print(pressures, m["efficiency"], m["exhaust_quality"],
              m["energy_residual_j_kg"], m["heater_residuals_j_kg"])
    else:
        print(row["status"], row["detail"])
```

After the search, review bleed fractions and the turbine exhaust.
Repeat at the declared stress conditions before comparing nominal and
robust candidates. For a simple cycle, copy the fixture model,
set `extraction=False`, and pass an empty candidate vector.

### Check single-point properties

```python
properties = Prepared({"kind": "property"})
for query in [[3e6, 300.0], [1e5, 0.5, 0.0]]:
    row = properties.evaluate(query)
    assert row["status"] == "complete", row
    print(row["metrics"]["state"])
```

The two-element vector means pressure and temperature. The
three-element vector means pressure, vapor mass fraction, and
zero as a sentinel. At saturation use the second form. The bounded
model covers IF97 regions 1, 2 and 4 within the documented pressure
and temperature limits. Use the official verification fixtures in
the supplied independent validation.

## 3. Batch candidates and replay the winner

```python
candidates = [
    {"id": "first", "parameters": case["parameters"]},
    {"id": "second", "parameters": case["parameters"]},
]
scores = prepared.scores(candidates, workers=2)["records"]
assert [row["id"] for row in scores] == ["first", "second"]
winner = min((r for r in scores if r["status"] == "complete"),
             key=lambda r: r["score"])
candidate = next(c for c in candidates if c["id"] == winner["id"])
replay = prepared.evaluate(candidate["parameters"], trace=True)
assert replay["status"] == "complete", replay
print(replay["score"], replay["metrics"])
```

Replace the duplicate vectors with distinct choices for a real search.
Use `batch` if you need the full metrics for every row. `scores` returns
ordered records with score, status, steps and detail, and `metrics: null`.
It rejects any candidate with `trace: true`. A one-worker batch or a
singleton runs inline. Larger batches can try two or four workers.
Measure before setting a worker count for a real workload.

The optional differential-evolution driver times preparation, seeded
search and traced replay as one run. Install SciPy for this example.

```sh
python -m pip install scipy
python validation/optimize_performance.py thermo_craft --scores
python validation/optimize_performance.py thermo_craft
```

The driver uses small local bounds and a short fixed search budget.
For a scientific result, use problem-specific bounds, an explicit
feasibility penalty or constraint policy, and a held-out evaluation.

## 4. Run and resume a local campaign

```sh
python validation/run_campaign.py thermo_craft models/campaign.json campaign.sqlite > first.json
python validation/run_campaign.py thermo_craft models/campaign.json campaign.sqlite > replay.json
cmp first.json replay.json
```

The manifest holds scenario models and candidate vectors. Keep IDs
unique inside each list. Reuse the database to resume identical work.
The native build, model, scenario, candidate and work settings are
part of cache identity. A new wheel re-evaluates cached work under
its own build identity. A cancel file passed as `cancel_file` or a
`wall_ms` budget can stop new evaluations cooperatively. Inspect
statuses in the attempt journal before rerunning.

## 5. Use the Rust CLI and benchmark

```sh
cargo build --release --locked --bins --examples
target/release/thermo-craft describe
target/release/thermo-craft run models/request.json
target/release/examples/sweep models/example.json
target/release/examples/performance models/example.json serial
CRAFT_SCORES=1 target/release/examples/performance models/example.json serial
```

The CLI reads a request file or standard input with `run -`. Exit code
0 indicates complete rows, 1 indicates a rejected request and 2
indicates one or more unsuccessful rows in a well-formed request.
The benchmark prints elapsed seconds per prepared batch after warm-up.
Use `parallel` for four workers, `trace` for traced evaluations,
or `domain` and `domain2` for the package's supplemental cases.
With a previous benchmark executable built from the baseline and this
one, `validation/performance_pair.py BEFORE AFTER models/example.json serial`
checks output parity and times both. See the included performance log
and raw evidence for the exact workloads and comparison boundaries.

## 6. Verify results

```sh
cargo test --release --locked
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --features python -- -D warnings
python validation/validate.py target/release/thermo-craft
```

Consult the [model card](model.md) for supported inputs, the
[architecture guide](architecture.md) for data flow and numerical
assumptions, and the [source notes](sources.md) for references.
